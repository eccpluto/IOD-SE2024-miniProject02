# IOD-SE2024-miniProject02
Repo for the second mini project.

The second mini-project is designed to cover the React concepts learned in modules 6 and 7. The goal is to create an interactive page/s of their choice using React. Ideally the app will include interactive elements such as forms, links and buttons, along with routes, data fetching and various React hooks as needed, as well as external libraries such as bootstrap and MUI.
