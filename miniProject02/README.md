# Mini Project 2: Lite Tube Plus

Aim is to allow a user to create playlists of videos from video hosting sites, without needing to create an account on those websites, i.e. they can create a single account on Lite Tube Plus (LTP). They can then log in anywhere to get their playlists and begin streaming.

From a high level, this app will allow the user to create an account / log in with general accouint management, and store a library of pointers to videos, playlists, and create playlists in a library.

The user will be able to play videos directly from their library.

As a bonus, I may add in the ability to convert video to audio and download video.
