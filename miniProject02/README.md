# ~~Mini Project 2: Lite Tube Plus~~

~~Aim is to allow a user to create playlists of videos from video hosting sites, without needing to create an account on those websites, i.e. they can create a single account on Lite Tube Plus (LTP). They can then log in anywhere to get their playlists and begin streaming.~~

~~From a high level, this app will allow the user to create an account / log in with general accouint management, and store a library of pointers to videos, playlists, and create playlists in a library.~~

~~The user will be able to play videos directly from their library.~~

~~As a bonus, I may add in the ability to convert video to audio and download video.~~

# Mini Project 2.1: Stockman

Stockman is intended to be a open source inspection platform for understanding market trends.

Stockman will allow a user to use the inspector tool to see a snapshot of various media, and the price of direct or indirect stocks. The user can optionally create an account which will enable both library and dashboard features, to bookmark queries / topics / stocks, and display prominant or custom inspections 

From a high level, this app will allow the user to create an account / log in with general accouint management, and store a library of pointers to videos, playlists, and create playlists in a library.

Queries can include:
- Stock name,
- Topics,
- Events,

There will be a scrollable time flow selector tool, which will allow the user to interrogate the same query in diffrent time frames - this will update the text, video and stock price results to reflect the time selected.

A high level indicator of (associated) stock price(s) will be displayed in the inspector tool, and will not change as the time flow selector is manupulated.
